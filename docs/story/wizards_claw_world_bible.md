# Yuvor's World Bible

## Game Overview
A magical action-adventure game using crane game mechanics for spell crafting. Players control Yuvor, a young badger wizard who reaches into her material pouch to grab ingredients for spells while exploring a wild, untamed world populated entirely by talking animals.

## World Foundation

### The Great Wildlands
**Setting**: A vast continent of untamed wilderness with scattered pockets of civilization
**Story Area**: The Northern Reaches - a region roughly the size of a state, stretching from the Lowland Meadows to the distant Grand Mound
**Time Period**: The Feral Ages - a primitive era without technology where animals have recently begun forming early societies

### Core Principles
- **No Humans**: Only animals exist in this world
- **Evolutionary Spectrum**: Animals range from fully evolved (speaking, walking upright, forming societies) to primal (instinct-driven, non-speaking)
- **Magic Discovery**: Magic is a relatively new discovery, difficult and dangerous to learn
- **Survival Focus**: Life revolves around gathering resources, particularly the three core materials needed for magic

## Magic System

### The Three Materials
**Fire Materials** (Red)
- *Examples*: Dry twigs, bark strips, pine needles, sulfur crystals
- *Magic Type*: Offensive spells, light sources, heat generation
- *Rarity*: Common in forests, rare in wetlands

**Leaf Materials** (Green)
- *Examples*: Healing herbs, berries, mushrooms, flower petals
- *Magic Type*: Healing, growth, nature manipulation
- *Rarity*: Seasonal availability, abundant in spring/summer

**Rock Materials** (Gray)
- *Examples*: Quartz shards, iron ore, precious gems, clay
- *Magic Type*: Defense, earth manipulation, enchantment
- *Rarity*: Found in specific geological areas, most valuable

### Spell Crafting Mechanics
- **Combination System**: Different ratios of materials create different spell effects
- **Basic Spells**: 2-material combinations (Fire + Leaf = Healing flame)
- **Advanced Spells**: 3-material combinations (Fire + Leaf + Rock = Explosive barrier)
- **Mastery Progression**: More experience allows for complex multi-material spells
- **Risk Factor**: Failed spells can backfire, depleting materials or causing harm
